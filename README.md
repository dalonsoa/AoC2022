Advent of Code 2022
-------------------

This year, I will use Dart, mainly because I have a project that uses Flutter and Dart
is the underlying programming language, and I need to gain some practice. 

Unless stated otherwise within each day, to run the code of Day X just do:

```bash
cd day_X
dart run
```

Some days I will upload something that just works. Hopefully, as time goes by, I will be
able to upload solutions that follow best coding practices, like modularity, testing,
documentation, etc. 

Hi performance will not be my main concern, so if anyone has a suggestion on how to make
the code more performing, any suggestion will be most welcomed!
